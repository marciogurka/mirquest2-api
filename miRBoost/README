# Name: miRBoost
# Version: 1.0
# Date: 11-20-2013
# Authors: Van Du Tran et al.
# Description: pre-miRNA predictor


System requirements:
  - miRBoost has been developped for Unix platform.
  - Perl and Java VM are required.

Unpacking
  unzip miRBoost.zip

Installation
  Directory miRBoost contains executable files to run the program. Should you would like to 
  recompile,
  
	cd miRBoost
  	make

Execution
  1. Calculate 187 features for input sequences
     -L 400: upper bound for all sequence sizes in input fasta. It can be appropriately 
	reduced to reduce running time.
     -D -1|1: class label for all sequences. It is required to treat positive and negative
	samples separately, then join them into a unique training or testing file.

  	./gFoldmulti/gFold -s wholepos_nobreak_400_97.fa -L 400 -DATA 1  > wholepos_187.txt
  	./gFoldmulti/gFold -s wholeneg_nobreak_400_97.fa -L 400 -DATA -1 > wholeneg_187.txt
  	cat wholepos_187.txt wholeneg_187.txt > train_187.txt
	head -100 wholepos_187.txt > test_187.txt
	head -100 wholeneg_187.txt >> test_187.txt

  2. Extract selected features from all features.
     SELECT="whole_selected_features.txt" for the cross-species training data
     SELECT="human_selected_features.txt" for the human training data
     If a new training set is used to build the model, you may follow our feature selection
     process to select the appropriate features.

  	./src/extractfeature.pl -s $SELECT -i train_187.txt -o train_selected.txt  
	./src/extractfeature.pl -s $SELECT -i test_187.txt -o test_selected.txt

  3. Run miRBoost, with delta = 0.25 (by default)
  	
	./miRBoost -i test_selected.txt -t train_selected.txt -d 0.25

Results
  The classification result is found in "results.txt". Each line represents the label of the 
  corresponding sequence.
